## How to load `qfive` package in R?

You can install the development version of qfive like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("APDataSc/qfive")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(qfive)

## basic example code
cmr_data22 <- data.frame(
  agegrp = c(15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45),
  women = c(725594, 728503, 671987, 623044, 591298, 558825, 476056),
  child_born = c(79100, 389089, 762811, 1069998, 1293875, 1393444, 1287071),
  child_dead = c(1757, 8282, 16627, 25003, 34509, 43514, 49648)
)

"q5 2022 - iussp"
ecu_nac_qx_iussp22 <- u5mr(
  cmr_data22,
  women = "women",
  child_born = "child_born",
  child_dead = "child_dead",
  agegrp = "agegrp",
  model = "CD West", #"UN General" "UN Latin" "UN South_Asian"
  svy_year = 2022+10/12+30/365,
  sex = "both",
  e_0 = 60,
  mac = 27.94587289
)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
